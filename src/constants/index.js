      "Developed AshFit, a high-performance full-stack e-commerce platform built with React.js, Node.js, and SQL. Engineered a decoupled architecture featuring a RESTful API with 30+ endpoints, achieving sub-200ms latency for real-time transactions. I streamlined operations by building a custom Admin Dashboard that reduced manual inventory management time by 50% and ensured 100% data integrity through automated Postman testing. To prioritize security, I implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and custom middleware to safeguard sensitive user and administrative data.",

      "AshStar is a high-performance, AI-powered gamified SaaS platform built using React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I engineered a visually immersive frontend utilizing GSAP and Lenis Scroll, achieving 95+ Lighthouse performance scores through hardware-accelerated animations. To ensure 24/7 reliability, I developed a multi-model failover system for the Google Gemini API and designed a complex MongoDB 'Neural Memory' schema to maintain data integrity across thousands of user interactions. Furthermore, I optimized the development lifecycle by implementing Docker, which reduced deployment times by 30% and ensured consistent production environments.",
